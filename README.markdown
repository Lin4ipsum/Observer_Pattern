# Observer Pattern

Basically it is a mechanism for one object to inform other ‘interested’ objects when its state changes.

It is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems.
